# Kubeflow Technical Oversight Committee

The Kubeflow Technical Oversight Committee (TODO: TOC or KTOC ?) is responsible for
cross-cutting product and design decisions.

The governance of Kubeflow is an open, living document, and will continue to evolve as the
community and project change.

## Charter

- Project direction and roadmap:

  - Consolidate together with WGs the overall technical direction and Kubeflow roadmap.

  - Suggest cross-WGs features like LLMOps and work with stakeholders to address it.

  - Create proposals based on TOC discussions and bring them to the relevant working groups for discussion.

  - Working with working groups on Kubeflow cross-component integrations.

  - Resolving issues that, despite best efforts, a working group has been unable to resolve.

- Project releases, security, and stability:

  - Ensure the stability of Kubeflow releases.

  - Set the priorities of individual releases to ensure coherency and proper sequencing.

  - Working together with Security WG to establish security guidelines to ensure Kubeflow follows
    the CNCF security best practices.

  - Advise the Conformance Committee on conformance rules and tests.

- Project oversight and scope:

  - Working together with Kubeflow Steering Committee (KSC) to establish guidelines for
    Kubeflow distributions and third-party applications.

  - Advise the KSC on creation and deletion Kubeflow working groups.

  - Advise the KSC on accepting new Kubeflow components and archiving existing
    Kubeflow components.

  - Advise the KSC on changes for Kubeflow distributions and third-party applications.

## Delegated Authority

TOC may choose to delegate its authority to other committees as-needed.

The committee currently recognizes this delegated authority for [To be set up]:

- Kubeflow components guidance is delegated to the appropriate [Working Groups](../wgs/wg-governance.md).

- Enforcing Kubeflow conformance program rules created by TOC and KSC is delegated to the
  [Conformance Committee](CONFORMANCE-COMMITTEE.md).

## Committee Meetings

TOC currently meets at least bi-weekly, or as-needed. Meetings are open to the public and held online,
unless they pertain to sensitive or privileged matters. Examples of such matters are:

- Private emails to the committee
- Certain Escalations
- Disputes between members
- Security reports

Meeting notes are available to members of the
[kubeflow-discuss mailing](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#kubeflow-mailing-list)
list, unless community member privacy requires otherwise.
Public meetings will be recorded and the recordings made available publicly.

Questions and proposals for changes to governance are posted as issues in the
[kubeflow/community](https://github.com/kubeflow/community) repository, and the TOC invites community
feedback there.

## Committee members

TOC is composed of 3 (three) members. They are elected according
to the election policy [TODO: add link].
No more than two seats may be held by employees of the same organization
(or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other).
Seats on the TOC are held by an individual, not by their employer.

The current membership of the committee is (listed alphabetically by first name):

## Decision process

The TOC desires to always reach consensus.

### Normal decision process

Decisions requiring a vote include:

- Issuing written policy.
- Amending existing written policy.
- Creating, removing, or modifying a working group.
- Accepting or removing Kubeflow components.
- Official responses to publicly raised issues.
- Any other decisions that at least half of the members (rounded down) present decide require a vote

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may pass with at
least half the members (rounded up) of the committee supporting it.

Quorum is considered reached when at least half of the members (rounded up) are present.
Members of TOC may abstain from a vote. Abstaining members will only be considered as
contributing to quorum, in the event that a vote is called in a meeting.

### Special decision process

Issues that impact the TOC governance require a special decision process. Issues include:

- Changes to the TOC charter
- TOC voting rules

The issue may pass with 70% of the members (rounded up) of the committee supporting it.

### Results

The results of the decision process are recorded and made publicly available,
unless they pertain to sensitive or privileged matters. The results will include:

- Description of the issue
- Names of members who supported, opposed, and abstained from the vote.
-

## Getting in Touch

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the steering committee at [TODO: add email]. This is a private discussion list to which
   all members of the committee have access.

1. Open an issue in the [kubeflow/community](https://github.com/kubeflow/community) repository and
   indicate that you would like attention from the TOC using GitHub label [TODO: add label].

## Changes to the charter

Changes to the TOC charter may be proposed via a PR on the charter itself. Amendments are accepted
following the [Special Decision Process](#special-decision-process) detailed above.

Kubeflow community members can propose changes and improvements to the existing TOC charter.

Proposals and amendments to the charter are available for at least a period of one week for
comments and questions before a vote will occur.
